# Prop-Designer

The prop designer is based on BEM theory and classic aerodynamics. The program will design the curvature angles of the airfoils along your prop give that you input / design the inital shape of the prop. 

Typical prop shapes will vary for the type of conditions you are designing for. The prop design in the program as the following cross-section:

   __________________________________            __________________________________
 /                                    \    _   /                                    \
|                                      |  |O| |                                      |
 \                                    /    -   \                                    /

The prop was designed simply by the merging of two geometries: a rectangle with two semi-circles on both ends.

Besides prop shape, the program takes in important variables that may change depending on your own design criteria and conditions.
